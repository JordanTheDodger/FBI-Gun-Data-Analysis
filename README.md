This project will educate us about trends of gun purchases in United States. The data is provided by FBI's NICS (National Instant Criminal Background Check System). The dataset has records from Novemeber 1998 to Septemver 2009. It desribes rules and regulation on who can buy guns legally and licensed merchants have to fullfill these contstraints while selling a gun to their customers. The licensed shopowners use this database to check if the person buying a gun have any criminal records. Another dataset US Census data will be used with NCIS to focus on statewise purchase of several kinds of firearms.
